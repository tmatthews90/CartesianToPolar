# CartesianToPolar
Basic Python script to turn cartesian coordinates (x,y) into polar coodinates (r,Î˜)

## Getting Started

1. Download CartesianToPolar.py
2. Navigate to the file in terminal
3. Enter the following command to run the application...
```
python CartesianToPolar.py
```
4. Enter in a X value, followed by a Y value.

Application will print out radius and theta value of (X,Y) coordinate.

To exit the application press `CTRL+C`

## Sample Output

Enter X: 4

Enter Y: 5

(4, 5)

Radius:	6.40312423743

Theta:	51.3401917459
